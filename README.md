# Welcome to Circle!

### Introduction
Circle is a social media platform designed to prioritise real-world meetups rather than encourage endless scrolling. Through an iterative design process involving user research, prototyping, and usability testing, our vision for the platform evolved considerably. 

### User Journey
On Circle, at first you will be prompted to login. If it's your first time on Circle you have the option to register. Once registered and logged in, you can start searching for other users, send friend requests join groups and events and edit your profile. To be able to see posts on you feed you need friends who are active posters. We made sure to make accounts for you where all functionalities are enabled, but feel free to also register.

### How to get started
Once the repository has been cloned, you'll have a folder named Circle_Group5, inside of that folder, there will be another folder called 'circle', this is where you want to run 'npm run dev', but first make sure that you have the dependencies installed.

If the connection to the port is successful, you should see this:

Keep it open for the entire duration of your testing, access http://localhost:5173/ via your browser and you can start your exploring.
